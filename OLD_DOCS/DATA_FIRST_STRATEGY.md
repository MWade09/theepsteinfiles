4. **Component Dependencies**: Many features already built, just need complete data
5. **Foundation for Growth**: Solid data architecture enables rapid feature development

## 📈 Success Metrics:

- **Search Results**: Global Search returns comprehensive results across all data types
- **Cross-References**: All people/events/transactions properly linked
- **Component Function**: All existing components work with complete data
- **Data Integrity**: Zero broken references or missing connections
