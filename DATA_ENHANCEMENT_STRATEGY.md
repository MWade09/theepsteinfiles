## Technical Infrastructure Improvements

### 1. Search & Discovery Enhancement
```typescript
// Enhanced search functionality needed
interface AdvancedSearch {
  fullTextSearch: string;
  dateRange: { start: string; end: string };
  entityTypes: string[];
  verificationStatus: string[];
  significance: string[];
  tags: string[];
  sourceTypes: string[];
}
```

### 2. Data Verification System
```typescript
// Multi-level verification system
interface VerificationLevel {
  level: 'verified' | 'probable' | 'disputed' | 'unverified';
  sources: Source[];
  crossReferences: string[];
  verificationDate: string;
  verifiedBy: string;
}
```

### 3. Relationship Strength Calculation
```typescript
// Algorithmic relationship strength calculation
interface RelationshipMetrics {
  frequency: number; // Number of documented interactions
  duration: number; // Length of relationship in months
  significance: number; // Calculated significance score
  evidence: number; // Number of supporting documents
  publicness: number; // How public/documented the relationship is
}
```

## Content Standards & Guidelines

### 1. Source Reliability Hierarchy
1. **Primary Sources** (Court documents, government records)
2. **Investigative Journalism** (Verified through multiple sources)
3. **Mainstream Media** (Established news organizations)
